Welcome to the Telemetry Streaming course! In this course we will:

Explore F5 Telemetry Streaming, by using a declarative API model to forward, aggregate and analyze BIG-IP telemetry.

During this hands-on lab you will learn the following:
•	How to use F5's declarative API to deploy applications via AS3. 
•	How to use F5's declarative API to collect application statistics via Telemetry Streaming.
•	How to use two data consumers to visualize statistics from Telemetry Streaming.


This lab will go through initial setup and add you to the Telemetry Streaming Agility 2020 workstation.
